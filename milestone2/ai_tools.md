Milestone 2: Set up Tools 

#55

Which AI tools did you try?
- Chatgpt
- Tabine 

What worked well? What didnâ€™t?
- Previously used Tabine for generating comments based on the code which worked somewhat well
- Generating large chunks of code does not work well, however asking it to generate small lines within a function you designed can sometimes work well.
- Debugging worked well, gave good suggestions (sometimes)


When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
- Debugging 
- Comments
- Syntax correction
