Milestone 1: Understanding of Focus Bear's mission and vision

#51

What was your first impression of the app?
- Well put, got straight to the point of the app, enjoyed the non-formal atmosphere it created

Did you find anything difficult to understand?


If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?
- App that keeps you from getting distracted

What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?
- If there was some default pre-selected options, that could help as sometimes when there is a decent amount to setup, individuals may not setup the app fully and utilise it. Perhaps like a pre-set settings for a university student, which would block generic websites and apps most university student would use and set the timings to timings of which the average uni student would be working (where this can be edited). Less work for the user.
